            <h5>What is travel insurance?</h5>
            <p>Travel insurance is a financial product designed to provide protection and coverage for unforeseen events that may occur during a trip. It typically offers a range of benefits, including coverage for medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost luggage, and other unexpected expenses. Travel insurance aims to mitigate the financial risks associated with travel by offering compensation or reimbursement for expenses incurred due to covered events. Policies can vary in terms of coverage, so travelers should carefully review the terms and conditions to ensure that their specific needs and concerns are addressed. Overall, travel insurance provides peace of mind for individuals embarking on domestic or international journeys, offering a safety net in case of unexpected disruptions or emergencies.</p>
