            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <h3>1. It is a cost-effective option</h3>
            <p>"The likelihood of encountering a severe illness is on a steady rise. Pollution rates continue to escalate, many food products are contaminated, and stress has become an unavoidable part of both adults' and children's lives. Procuring sufficient health insurance for your dependents is no longer merely an option; it has become an essential requirement. Family health insurance plans offer a more cost-effective approach to covering your beloved family members. Instead of disbursing premiums for multiple policies, you consolidate payments into a single plan, ensuring the security of everyone under it."</p>
            <h3>2. It is convenient and free from hassle</h3>
            <p>Recalling various payment schedules for different policies can be tiring and perplexing. Each policy might adhere to its unique payment timetable, involving monthly installments for some and yearly payments for others. Juggling these alongside work and other obligations can prove challenging. However, a family plan effectively closes this gap, streamlining payments and transforming the entire process into a stress-free experience.</p>
            <h3>3. It enables tax benefits</h3>
            <p>Tax deductions can be claimed on the premiums paid for family health insurance plans according to Section 80D* of the Income Tax Act of 1961. You have the opportunity to claim up to ₹25,000 for yourself and an additional ₹30,000 for your parents, totaling ₹55,000 within a single financial year</p>
            <h3>4. It simplifies the process of securing new additions to your family</h3>
            <p>In the event of welcoming a new baby, you have the flexibility to include the newest family member in your current family plan. There's no necessity to purchase a new policy whenever there's an addition to your family. Additionally, family health insurance plans offer the flexibility of including parents-in-law, ensuring comprehensive coverage for both your parents and your spouse’s parents under a single policy.</p>
            <h3>5. Reduced rates and supplementary coverage options</h3>
            <p>Depending on the count and ages of members, you can access advantages such as maternity coverage or family-related discounts. These supplementary offerings render family packages a more advantageous choice compared to individual plans.</p>
